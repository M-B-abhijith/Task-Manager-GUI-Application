# Todo-List-GUI-Application-Adv
Developed a Todo application with a graphical user interface using Python.
Utilized object-oriented programming principles, employing classes to manage tasks and application
functionality.
This application allows users to create tasks and manage them with a hierarchical structure, where each task can have multiple subtasks. 
The GUI is designed to be intuitive, enabling users to add, delete, and organize their tasks and subtasks efficiently.
